ELN statistics cover all the sites in the ELN consortium, individually and collectively SFU statistics only cover SFU. You will also see that different kinds of statistics are available: under the """"status"""" column, there are up to 4 categories: www, telnet, full, and connections. Here is what each category provides:<p>www - the number of web based connections to the databases<p>telnet - the number of telnet based connections. The last of the telnet interfaces was phased out last August, so from September 2001 onwards these stats should be in the neighbourhood of zero.<p>full - the number of web and telnet based connections combined. As of September 2001, this should be the same as the number of web connections.<p>connections - This category is a bit tricky: it's the number of refused connections.  The most likely cause for turn-aways is the simultaneous user restriction currently in place for the Wilson databases.<p>Given the above, it's most likely you will be interested in full statistics for the ELN group.

Individual sites are specified by NLC codes. <p>It gets time consuming to review statistics on a month-by-month basis. Here's how to combine statistics for multiple months:<p>Next to the Start date for each report type, there is a check box. Check the boxes for each month that you want to include in the cumulative report. Be careful: generally it's best to check only one box for each month. For example, if you want to measure overall usage for your institution, check only the box next to the full report for ELN users. Checking multiple boxes in a single month can cause the totals to become greatly inflated.<p>When you are done checking boxes, return to the top of the page, and click the """"Combine Reports"""" button.
