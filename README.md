## Patches
### Context Module
Menu Trails in Context are an ongoing issue which requires Context to be continuously patched. The current patch can be [found on Drupal.org](https://drupal.org/node/835090). The patch name is _context-835090-72.patch_.

**Do not update the Context module** unless it's a security update and please test thoroughly locally before applying on the live site. Look for Contexts that have a **Menu** or **Menu trail** reaction.
