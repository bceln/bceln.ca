Description

Provides integration between Organic Groups and Mailman Mailing Lists


List Visibility

Mailing Lists can be "linked" to one or more Groups.  Visibility of "linked" Mailing Lists is then controlled by the Mailman Groups module. The List will be made invisible on all standard forms where it would othewise be shown unless it is made visible by one or more conditions defined in "Linked Groups".  In typical use, a List set to be invisible to users who are not members of the linked Group.


List Auto-subscribe

List auto-subscribe works when a user joins a linked Group after registration.  The feature is not active if a Group is joined during initial user registration.
