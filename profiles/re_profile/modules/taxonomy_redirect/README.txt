This module allows the administrator to change the destination of Taxonomy Term
links. Ordinarily these links go to taxonomy/term/TERMID but that is not
always desirable. Using this module, you could redirect these links to custom
content, or content generated by the Views module.

Due to the way the taxonomy module handles these redirects, they are available
only on a by-vocabulary basis; you cannot redirect them for individual terms.

To install this module:

Copy the taxonomy_redirect directory to your Drupal modules directory, then
enable the module in admin/modules. You can then go to admin/taxonomy_redirect
to set up the redirections.
