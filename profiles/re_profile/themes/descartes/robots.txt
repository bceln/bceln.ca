# robots.txt
#
# This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts
# of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo!
# and Google. By telling these "robots" where not to go on your site,
# you save bandwidth and server resources.
#
# This file will be ignored unless it is at the root of your host:
# Used:    http://example.com/robots.txt
# Ignored: http://example.com/site/robots.txt
#
# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
# http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html
#
# For syntax checking, see:
# http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/robots/check.html
#
# This is a slightly modified version of the robots.txt file that ships
# with Drupal 6. To use it, copy or move this file into the web root
# directory. This file will be completely ignored if left in this directory.

# The "Disallow: /sites/" rule makes no sense if there are files in
# /sites/default/files/ that need to be indexed.
#
# Disallow: /sites/
#
# We could use the rule "Allow: /sites/default/files/", but the "Allow"
# directive is supposedly not widely supported. Consequently, we just
# use "Disallow" to block specific directories within the files directory:
#
Disallow: /sites/all/
Disallow: /sites/default/libraries/
Disallow: /sites/default/modules/
Disallow: /sites/default/themes/
Disallow: /themes/
