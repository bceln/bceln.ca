EXPERIMENTAL TABULA RASA ("BLANK SLATE") THEME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an experimental sub-theme for the Descartes theme. It works, but there's
still a lot we don't know about how sub-themes interact with their parent themes.

This theme currently provides almost no files or styles of its own, thus the
Latin name (which is also the name of the epistemological thesis that ALL
knowledge is gained via perception and experience...) 


Directions:

1.	Move the directory containing this file into any valid theme location such as
		/sites/all/themes or /sites/default/themes;
2.	[optional] If renaming the theme, replace occurrences of 'tabularasa' with
		the name of the new theme in ALL files and ALL filenames;
3.	Activate the theme in at /admin/build/themes/

Questions:

*	Can we call functions from the parent template.php file?
* Can we override the parent style.css file?
